# Project GreenGuard

**Project Title:** GreenGuard <br>
**Project Author:** Rashed Rifat

## What and Why?

One of the major problems that we, as a species, face in the next few years is the drastic effect that climate change has on the planet. We can already see some of these effects through the record-breaking temperatures recorded globally, forest fires becoming more frequent and the strain on our clean energy and water reserves. While many of these problems require new infrastructure, systems and technologies to be put into place, a strong social awareness and a coordinated effort is still crucial to implementing these changes. This is societal push is what Project GreenGuard will attempt to deliver.

The goal of Project GreenGuard is to create a new web application/website where users are able to, based on their location, see a map of their local area overlaid with the current level of a selected environmental factor (such as C02 emissions, air pollution, etc). An explanation should be present detailing the effect this had on the local environment as well as the effect it has on its residents directly. The user should also be able to receive an ordered list of which activities contribute to the factor as well as a list of possible solutions to take, including donations to local organizations, lifestyle changes and events.

## For Whom?

This application is primarily aimed towards the general public, especially those that may not be aware of the severity that climate change can have. A probable user of this software is curious about climate change, would like to learn more or is motivated to contribute personally. While they may have a dim understanding that climate change is important, and may support it, they will most likely not have taken action personally.

This application should attempt to inform the user without making any assumptions to their level of education or dedication to the movement. The application should also attempt to stress the importance of taking immediate actions (the implementation of which amy be discussed fuhrer).

## How?

From the end-user perspective, assuming that they have navigated to the application, should be greeted with a homepage that welcomes to the app and details to how to use it. It should include a few small articles/blurbs detailing the importance of climate change and its primary factors (CO2 emissions, deforestation, plastic waste, etc). It should then prompt the user if they would like to explore how it affects them and ask for their location (the list of possible valid locations can be limited by the scope the project and the resources allocated).

Upon entering their information and the factor that they would like to explore in greater detail, they should be directed to a new page that features a map of the location they have selected. The distribution of the factor they have chosen should be layered on top and the option to switch layers or locations should be present on the page.

As the user navigates the map and selects a particular region to explore more, they should be greeted with a pop-up explaining the current effect that the factor has on the environment (for example, increased CO2 emissions leader to higher average temperatures, etc) as well as the activities which have contributed the most to this factor. The pop-up should be able to be closed if the user wishes to return to the map and explore more or should feature a button directing them to the actions that they can take for the future.

The actions page should feature possible steps that the user can take immediately, including tips such as donations to local organizations, lifestyle changes and events. The solutions on this page should be specific to the region as well as factor selected (for example, planting trees within a relatively non-wooded area to reduce CO2 emissions).

## Scope

When introducing this project, it may seem that it is highly ambitious, perhaps too ambitious for a team of 4 - 5 developers to handle effectively. However, this project can be easily scaled according to the suit the capabilities of the team by either reducing the amount of factors offered, limiting the location for which this application is applicable for or eliminating some of the more complex features to implement.

This project, at its core, required the creation of several pages, the ability to display data in an interactive map, store and query the data based on user input, and redirect users between these features. This should be something that is accomplishable by a team of developers. It is also a good mix of both front- and backend, allowing developers to contribute to features they feel most comfortable with. Finally, as mentioned before, the difficulty of the project can be scaled up or down, if necessary.
